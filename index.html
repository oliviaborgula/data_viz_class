    <p class="body-text">(Text via Britannica) In January 1999, Stewart replaced Craig Kilborn on 'The Daily Show', a parodic news program on the Comedy Central cable network that satirizes media, politics and pop culture. With Stewart as anchor, the show increased its viewership dramatically. .</p>
    <p class="body-text">During the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign, its “Indecision 2000” coverage — featuring Daily Show correspondents reporting from the caucuses and national conventions — became so popular that on election night its viewership rivaled that of some traditional news programs</p>
    <p class="body-text">The host played a role in launching the careers of many prominent comedians and correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, and Hasan Minhaj.  </p>
    <p class="body-text">He had relatively consistent amount of guests each year until 2015 — his last year hosting until his return in 2924. There was a slight dip in 2007, which also saw special anniversary programs with no guests. </p>

    <p class="body-text">Stewart invited more media and politician-related guests onto the show in the early 2000s and 2010s.</p>
    <p class="body-text">While at first actors, musicians and comedians dominated, they sharply fell, even though the overall guest count remained the same, as Stewart invited on a more diverse group of perspectives.</p>
